This algorithm was created for sdbm (a public-domain reimplementation of ndbm) 
database library. it was found to do well in scrambling bits, causing better 
distribution of the keys and fewer splits. it also happens to be a good 
general hashing function with good distribution. The actual function 
is hash(i) = hash(i - 1) * 65599 + str[i]; what is included below 
is the faster version used in gawk. There is even a faster, duff-device 
version. The magic constant 65599 was picked out of thin air while experimenting 
with different constants, and turns out to be a prime. this is one of the 
algorithms used in berkeley db (see sleepycat) and elsewhere.
